        <li> CodeU is a five-month development program for high potential university students to strengthen their skills and prepare them to become successful candidates for future technical opportunities.
        <li>Built and presented a wikipedia search engine that had features like multi-threaded web crawler, text suggestion using Lucene, TF/IDF-based heuristics to rank relevant Wiki pages.</li>
        <li>Went though a comprehensive technical bootcamp under the guidance of a Google software engineer</li></ul></p>
        
        <p><font color="#000">eBay Inc.</font><br>May 2016 - July 2016<ul><li>
          
Worked with the platforms team to build a DevOps dashboard. Used Javascript, HTML, CSS to build a Node.js web application.</li>
<li>Also worked on a Trends widget that scraped fashion trends from popular websites like Vogue, Elle, etc. and searched for the corresponding listings on the website.</li></ul></p>

        <li><p><font color="#000">Web Intelligence and Social Computing(WiSoc) Lab</font><br>
        Currently working on a Deep Learning Algorithm for text summarization. Previously worked on an algorithm that uses weighted minimum vertex cover to score sentences to generate summary. I also used Wikipedia based topic identification to remove dummy features and implemented algorithms to reduce redundancy in extractive text summarization. I also modeled the text as a graph and used graph based algorithms to generate abstractive summaries.</p></li>
