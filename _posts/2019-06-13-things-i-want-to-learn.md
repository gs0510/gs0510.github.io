- Read all the papers in Barbara Liskov's [recommended list for computer scientists](http://jpirker.com/hlf16-liskovs-reading-list-for-computer-scientists/)

- Organise a missing maps mapathon! A lot of places are not on the map and when disasters strike, the first responders have no way of getting to the affected areas. The [missing maps](https://www.missingmaps.org/) is a non-profit that organises volunteers to go over satellite data and mark places on OpenStreet maps.


- A paper from Sun systems in the 90s that is still very releavnt [https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/distributed_systems/a-note-on-distributed-computing.pdf](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/distributed_systems/a-note-on-distributed-computing.pdf)
