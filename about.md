Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I am Gargi and I am currently working as a software engineer at Vercel!

In the past I worked on the OCaml ecosystem at [Tarides](https://tarides.com/), attended the Recurse Center(it's pretty rad, you should definitely check it out!), volunteered for AddisCoder, wrote code for Bloomberg, Uber, eBay and the Linux Kernel! =)

If you have any questions or feedback, I would love to hear from you! Please feel free to reach out. :) My email is gs051095 at gmail dot com!
