Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I am Gargi and I am currently working as a software engineer at Tarides! It's a pretty cool jorb, as I get to work on the OCaml ecosystem!

In the past I attended the Recurse Center(it's pretty rad, you should definitely check it out!), volunteered for AddisCoder, wrote code for Bloomberg, Uber, eBay and the Linux Kernel! =)

If you have any questions or feedback, I would love to hear from you! Please feel free to reach out ðŸ˜„
